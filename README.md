Ok I want to use my shader SDk and make a flutter based app that is a digital version of this board game https://www.geekyhobbies.com/abalone-board-game-review-and-rules/ https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/201106/physicshistory.cfm please use my SDK https://github.com/Domusgpt/vib3codeSDKv3.0.0/tree/feature/holographic-exhale-fix-2970824138550486291 give the game haptic feed back, bombastic animations And effects and have the players spheres be circular cutouts that each has a unique version of the Vib3code sdk shader. Use Holographic on side and quantum on the other. Have their geometry and parameter setting react and change with the players positioning and number of balls left compared to their opponent. The losing player being redder and more chaotic with lower density and higher speed in this visualizer setting. Have every user input event and possible moment of gameplay uniquely and smoothly perform visualizer parameter changes to reflect the game play instant. Combine this with R/B chromatic Avberation, moiré glitchy offset RGB frequency lines and boma st vaporware effects and complimentary to the visualizer reactive elements. With holographic vapor wave neoskeunorphic UI design. Have everything work with visual information being convey in the emergency unified visual sound and haptic systems. Use exaggerated bona stic effects and try and give it a woah impactful professional developed vibe# Icosatabolne
